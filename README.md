## Why make this app
- Accountants from all banks are stopping or begging you to open a bank account, and there is no way to avoid them if you tell them that you have opened an account with that bank, whether it is true or false, but one way to avoid them is to have this fake SMS messages app, with which you can show them you have an account.
